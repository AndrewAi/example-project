##### Project Overview



##### Team Members
We elected to complete this project as a team.
The team members are:
- Seasca the dog
- Marco the dog
- Mog the cat
All team members contributed to all aspects of the project.
However, Seasca was given the lead in documentation, Marco the lead in Python coding, and Mog was given the lead in front-end development (HTML, CSS and JS) and user experience.

##### Meetings
Team meetings were held every Tuesday at 11am in the canteen at GMIT's Dublin Road campus for the duration of the project.
At these meetings, the management of the project was discussed, among other topics.
The project was divided into separate tasks, and each task was assigned to team members - usually on an individual basis.
At each meeting, Mog took notes using their laptop and assigned the tasks using GitHub Issues.
